I recommend reading both of these "getting started" texts which explain typescript to a programmers of different "paradigms":

 "Typescript for JS programmers": https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html in order to understand how TS relates to JS.

Typescript for Java/C# Programmers: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-oop.html 

Now, the first exercise is to initialize a typescript workspace and get familiar with the tsconfig file
