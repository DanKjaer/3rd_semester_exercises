### 1. Introduction
The project is an interdisciplinary software development project involving essential parts of the curriculum for this semester, including topics from all three subjects taught on the semester: Programming II, Systems Development II and Technology II *(except for CDS Networking, which is examined independently using a multiple choice test prior to this)*. Briefly explained, you should develop a distributed web-based application and write a report documenting the product and the process. 

The project can be accomplished in cooperation with an external partner – a private enterprise, a public institution, a club/association etc. The project group could choose to establish its own enterprise and ‘cooperate’ with it. Alternatively, the project can be made up by the group.

The group is responsible for formulating a project definition consisting of a problem definition and general requirements for the project. Maybe your partner has a well-defined project. If not, it is up to you to define it in cooperation with your partner. These activities take place in a pre-project. The project definition must be approved by the teachers at the end of the pre-project period (see semester special dates).

### 2. Practical information
The group size must not exceed 4. Any exception to this requirement must be approved by the semester coordinator, Alex Uldahl Pedersen.

The important dates regarding the exam will be in the semester special dates.

### 3. Pre-Project
In the pre-project you must outline a project definition that clarifies purpose, functionality and other important requirements and constraints of your project. This project definition must be approved before the full-time project period begins. (There will be no teaching in the courses Programming II and Systems Development II from weeks 46 and onwards, since this time is exclusively dedicated towards the exam project).


### 4. Requirements – process, product and security
As a general guideline, the project should involve essential parts of the semester curriculum for the relevant courses. More specific requirements to the process, product and security are described below.

#### 4.1 The process (Systems Development)
You are required to use a development practices covered during this course. This involves:
- Making a pipeline with Github Actions to automate relevant processes like testing
- You must produce tests that are relevant to your solution using one or more testing tools and practices covered during the semester
- Having a git branching strategy and following this during development
- Using a development methodology (like a variant of Agile, such as Extreme Programming or Scrum)

#### 4.2 The product (Programming)
- The solution must be a distributed application, consisting of 2 (or more) independent applications.
    - You must produce an Angular application.
    - You must produce a .NET backend
    - You must communicate with a relational database from your .NET application
    - You must facilitate communication between client and server using HTTP
    - You must have a non-trivial/generic domain model with relevant business logic

#### 4.3 The security (Technology II security + virtualization)
- The solution should include user authentication with secure password storage and access control.
Furthermore, security measures with focus on preventing the most common categories of vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) must be explicitly documented in the report.




### 5. Exam
There are two exams in January 2023

Exam in the subjects Programming II and Technology II
Exam in the subject Systems Development II
Both exams are based on the same interdisciplinary software development project, which was described in the previous chapters. The examination procedure for each of these exams is described below.

A report must be written and submitted along with the projects source code to Wiseflow.

The report must as a minimum include:

- Cover page with project title
- Table of contents
- Introduction
- Project definition for the project as a whole
- The product and security part
    - System overview & Architecture
    - Solution implementation
    - Security measures (OWASP top 10)
- The systems development part
    - Applied development methodologies
    - Branching strategy
    - Software tests
    - CI/CD pipeline
Conclusion
Bibliography
Appendices

The report must not exceed 24.000 characters including spaces and footnotes.

#### 5.1 Procedure for the exam in the subjects Programming II and Technology II
This exam is an internal individual oral exam based on the SDP and CDS parts of the interdisciplinary project. It has a total duration of 30 minutes (incl. evaluation and communication of grade).

The student presents a central topic of the project the first 10 minutes. The presentation should include demonstration of code. The presentation is followed by an examination dialogue (15 minutes) where all topics from the subjects SDP and CDS may be involved.

A single grade will be given based on a general assessment of the SDP and CDS part of the project and the oral performance during the examination.

#### 5.2 Procedure for the exam in the subject Systems Development
This exam is an internal individual oral exam based on the Systems Development part of the interdisciplinary project. It has a total duration of 20 minutes (incl. evaluation and communication of grade).

The student presents central topics of the project the first 10 minutes. The presentation is followed by an examination dialogue (5 minutes) where all topics from the subject may be involved.

A single grade will be given based on a general assessment of the project and the oral performance during the examination.
