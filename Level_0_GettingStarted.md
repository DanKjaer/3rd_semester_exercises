Before you start the unit test exercises at level 1,
I recommend taking some time getting familiar with the .NET command line interface (CLI).

You can always write --help after a command to get help (like valid arguments / options, what the command does, etc)

Try exploring and using the following commands:

dotnet new [application type here]
dotnet build
dotnet run
dotnet test
