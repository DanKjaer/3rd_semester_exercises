### Presentation topics:
- (Micro) Object-Relational-Mappers with Dapper
- PostgreSQL with ElephantSQL
- Npgsql (connection library from Nuget)
- Brief introduction to Datagrip

**Recommended actions:**
- Sign up for a free managed database plan at https://www.elephantsql.com or run a Postgres database from another vendor or locally on your own machine
- Install some sort of database navigator tool capable of sending request to a Postgres database. (I recommend Jetbrains Datagrip or simply using the extension inside Rider)
- Do the exercises in the same directory as this readme file.

### Literature & documentation (high priority reading is in *italics*):
- ElephantSQL getting started: https://www.elephantsql.com/docs/index.html
- *Npgsql docs: Getting started:* https://www.npgsql.org/doc/index.html *(I recommend reading this one, installation and basic usage chapters)*
