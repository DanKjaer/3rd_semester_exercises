Exercises: I recommend going from first chapter here: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps

To the chapter "Arrays".

Then arrays exercises.

(Functions and objects sections and their chapters can be skipped. You largely understand functions and objects already, and since we'll end up using Typescript(builds on top of Javascript), which has it's own type system, the "objects" section is not very important)

For the next time (before FETCH)
"Asynchronous Javascript" is also good
