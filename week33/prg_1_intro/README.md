### Presentation topics:
- Welcome to 3rd semester
- Introduction to .NET & C#
- Types
- Making a console application
- Properties, fields, attributes
- The .NET CLI tool & build system

**Recommended actions:**
- Reading the course info practical infos for programming II and systems development II. 
- Setting up your development environment (check tech stack part of course_info.md in the monorepo 
https://github.com/uldahlalex/3rd_semester_exercises/blob/main/course_info.md )
- Begin your 3rd semester development journey with "Getting started" exercises
    - (clone the monorepo linked at the top on Moodle, or go to this link to find the files for today: 
    https://github.com/uldahlalex/3rd_semester_exercises/tree/main/week33/prg_1_intro )
- Continue with some basic C# method writing in the calculator exercises.

These first two weeks will be packed with C# programming and learning about API bulding.

The first bigger project we're working towards, is the week 35 assignment(right after the 2 weeks of coding with me): 
**Creating a full backend application for a web frontend**.



### Relevant documentation, literature & links (high priority reading is in *italics*):
- Download .NET 8: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (and also pick an IDE of your choice. 
My personal recommendation is Rider by Jetbrains, which you have a student license for).
