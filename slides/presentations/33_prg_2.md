## Agenda

- Application structure
- Project types
- Nuget package manager

---

### .csproj

- All projects are "build-able"
- Some projects are executable
- All projects may have references (dependencies)

---

### What are you actually "referencing"?

- The compiled .dll file (build output)
<br>
C#, F#, VB  -> .dll

---


### Package managers in general

- Build and ship packages instead of re-writing code
- Allows down/up -loading from package registries

---

### Nuget in particular

- GUI and CLI UI's
- Simply "adds" references to some package existing on the registry
