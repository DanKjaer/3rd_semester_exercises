👨‍💻Greetings, fellow devs!👨‍💻

These are all of the exercises for the entirety of Programming II.
By the time you reach the end of all the exercises and assignments, 
you should be perfectly ready to take on the final boss: The exam project!

The structure of the exercises are as follows:

All exercises have a task, a success criteria(goal) and a learning objective(why I made this / what I want you to understand).

With few exceptions (it is noted when + "Further resources"), I made everything myself, so if you have any problems, please reach out to me, I'd be delighted to help.

On Moodle you can see what levels are dedicated to which presentations/days.

Best regards
Alex
