👨‍💻Greetings, fellow devs!👨‍💻

These are all of the exercises for the entirety of Programming II.
By the time you reach the end of all the exercises and assignments, 
you should be perfectly ready to take on the final boss: The exam project!

The structure of the exercises are as follows:

All exercises have a task, a success criteria(goal) and a learning objective(why I made this / what I want you to understand).

With few exceptions I made everything myself (it is noted when + "Further resources" is 3rd party resources I find helpful). If you have any problems, please reach out to me, I'd be delighted to help.

Moodle is primarily used for describing the topics for each day.

Best regards
Alex
