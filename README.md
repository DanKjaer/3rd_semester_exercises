üë®‚ÄçüíªGreetings, fellow devs!üë®‚Äçüíª

These are all of the exercises for the entirety of Programming II.
By the time you reach the end of all the exercises and assignments, 
you should be perfectly ready to take on the final boss: The exam project!

The structure of the exercises are as follows:

The first many exercises have unit tests, so you quickly can assess if you're on the right path.
The later exercises do not necessarily have tests, since formulating tests may not be
reasonable, but it should be very clear to you when you've successfully solved the exercise / assignment.
Similarly, not every exercise has guided solution for the same reasons.

I made absolutely everything myself, so if you have any problems, please reach out to me, I'd be delighted to help.

Best regards
Alex
