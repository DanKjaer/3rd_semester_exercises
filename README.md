#### 👨‍💻Greetings, fellow devs!👨‍💻

These are all of the course content for the entirety of Programming II & Systems Development II.
By the time you reach the end of all the exercises and assignments, you should be perfectly ready to take on the final boss: The exam project!

The structure of this repository is the following:
Weeks are divided into individual "days", like programming day 1 or systems development day 2.
Each day will have a README.md file with the info about that particular day + exercises, links, documentation, etc.

All exercises/projects have a task, a success criteria(goal) and a learning objective(why I made this / what I want you to understand).

With few exceptions I made all exercises and projects myself (it is noted when that is not the case. "Further reading" is always 3rd party resources I find helpful). If you have any problems, please reach out to me, I'd be delighted to help.

Moodle is primarily used for describing the topics for each day. This repository is the single source of truth for any course content. Semester info is still on Moodle here: https://moodle.easv.dk/course/view.php?id=2906

I recommend making your way to the course_info.md file and starting there, before making your way to day 1 of week 33.

**Best regards,**<br>
