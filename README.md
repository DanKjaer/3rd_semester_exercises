#### üë®‚ÄçüíªGreetings, fellow devs!üë®‚Äçüíª

These are all of the course content for the entirety of Programming II & Systems Development II.
(If you're reading this on Moodle, the repository is located here: https://github.com/uldahlalex/3rd_semester_exercises/  The markdown files from the repository are simply embedded into Moodle)

The structure of this repository is the following:
- Weeks are divided into individual "days", like "programming day 1" or "systems development day 2" of that particular week.
- Each day will have a README.md file(embedded into Moodle) with the info about that particular day (presentation topics, links, documentation, etc.) The Exercises, however, must all be accessed from the repository.

Semester info is still on Moodle here: https://moodle.easv.dk/course/view.php?id=2906

I recommend starting out by reading this file to get some basic info about this Programming II and Systems Development II.


**Best regards,**<br>

### THE TECH STACK FOR THE ENTIRE SEMESTER
 These are the stuff we'll be using (and with optional links to where these can be installed):

- PostgreSQL (Get a fully managed DB server for free here: https://www.elephantsql.com/ [No payment details required]). You can also download postgres locally on your machine and use that if you wish to be completely offline (fully free and open source)
- .NET 8 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 
- Nodejs 18.x (install latest LTS version using Node Version Manager, see recommended tools below)
- Angular 16 (install using npm bundled with Nodejs)
- Ionic 7 (install using npm bundled with Nodejs)
- Postman HTTP Client ( https://www.postman.com/downloads/ )
- Github for Actions (For CI/CD) (You don't need a paid plan)

Tools i recommend installing that will make your lives easier:
- Node version manager: 
LINUX / MAC, Follow instructions in README.md: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
WINDOWS: download the nvm-setup.exe from here: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.11 and run it
- Rider: Install using Jetbrains Toolbox (just like IntelliJ)
- Datagrip: Install using Jetbrains Toolbox (just like IntelliJ)
- Git bash(For Windows users) (you probably already have it since it's commonly installed along with Git)

A couple notes on tech stack decisions for those who are interested:
- I generally prefer free and open source software, and want to give you the possibility to run your programs locally and offline before you deploy(hence why PostgreSQL). 
- Everything I push is cross operating system compatible, and you can use just about any machine and operating system in the world without any difficulties. 
- The most demanding programs are Rider and Datagrip - if these are too demanding for your machine, I recommend installing VS Code and using extensions instead of a full-fledged IDE, since it can run on much fewer resources: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### How the course is taught

Programming II (and Systems Development II for that matter) will be taught as a mixture of these elements:

- **Presentations** (Introducing new topics, verbal and partly visual, mostly non-participating) 

- **Exercises** (Repetitive, shorter duration, smaller domain area, focused)

- **Projects** (Longer running, in-depth, business-oriented problem solving, many participating domain areas, participating, but lacks "repetition") *[Week 35 project, compulsory assignment, exam projcet]*

- **Literature / documentation** (In-depth and informative, but non-participating)

- **Video-based content** (Walkthrough-based, demonstrating, hands-on)

It is my personal philisophy that mixing all 5 styles is beneficial for your learning outcome. I acknowledge personal working/studying preferences, and try to keep all styles of learning present throughout all major topics covered. 

### How I design exercises

All exercises/projects have a task, a success criteria(goal) and a learning objective(why I made this / what I want you to understand).

With few exceptions I made all exercises and projects myself (it is noted when that is not the case). If you have any problems, please reach out to me, I'd be delighted to help.

### My recommendations for taking this course
- My presentation slides are public, since I want total transparency, but I don't recommend you bother "reading" slides - they simply exist in order to guide my presentations. If you want to read, please see the relevant literature+documentation for each lecture.


### Stuff i left out (aka. what I wish we had time for)
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, etc. This is covered in 4th semester DevOps and the bachelor's programme)
- "alternative" request and response formats and HTTP verbs (we'll stick to GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and mostly work with JSON)
- API versioning (Covered in 4th semester Full-stack)
- We'll work a lot with async in the frontend with Promises, but primarily I'll demonstrate synchronous programming on the backend.
- The course does not aim to make you an excellent Javascript developer, but functions as an introduction to making modern Javascript applications using a framework (Angular).
- We will cover just enough HTML and light CSS to be able to use Angular.
- We don't cover other types of API's than HTTP-based REST(-ish). (No gRPC, MQTT, SOAP, GraphQL, Kafka, Websockets. *Some of these may be covered in a very interesting elective subject I have in the works for 4th semester, though...üïµÔ∏è)*
- Noteworthy Nuget packages (.NET libraries) commonly used in enterprise IT I decided to leave out due to time constraints/better alternatives/not fit for course needs are the following (You may use these if you like for exam and projects, but I don't include these in lectures):
    - Automapper (And any other Mapping library for that matter)
    - Mediatr
    - Fluent Validation (I use Data Annotations validation)
    - Entity Framework (I use Dapper)
    - (more will probably make this list)
