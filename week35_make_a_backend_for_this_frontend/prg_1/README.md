The presentation of the week 35 assignment is considered to be part of systems development, and the info is therefore contained inside that Moodle course (the README.md file for sys_1 this week).

I will be present throughout the lessons this week, however there will not be any presentations: Just project work. I'll just assist you in your pursuits of making amazing software.

The description for the assignment can be found in this directory on Github (the monorepo: see the link on the top of this page).
